## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts includes
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Varialbes
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was having issues getting the desktop site lined up properly. I was able to figure out that align-items: center; can make things look weird and for this project for the desktop view I ended up using align-items: start; which corrected the whole problem.

This is also one of the rare projects that I had to use height: fit-content; because display: flex; was forcing the parent to be smaller than the children and the background needed to be exactly the same height as the children for the box-shadow to be properly placed.

### Continued development

I decided not to use react or sass on this project so I could get back to the bascis as a large number of my projects are excessive and have features they dont need.

Through out the future I am looking to keep projects to the minimal features needed to be successful.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3scools.com) - I use this when I can remeber a certain syntax. For this project I used it for CSS Variable and linear-gradient syntax.

- [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This is an amazing resource. I looked up some stuff that was not really helpful but ended up leading me to figure out the problem on my own.
